## About <a name = "about"></a>

The suicide rate of patients with depression has been increasing in recent years. We trained this model by analyzing
232,074 pieces of text data. It is a machine learning-based algorithm for text classification and a computational method
for semantic sentiment analysis. The experimental results show that it can effectively predict the sentiment of
depression patientsâ€™ blog posts on social media such as Twitter or Facebook. This allows physicians to intervene in
advance when a depressed patient attempts to harm himself.
